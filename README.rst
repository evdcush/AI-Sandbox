AI Sandbox
##########
A space I use to explore and implement various methods and models within AI. High-level libraries are mostly eschewed; instead I try to constrain my implementations to NumPy. Simplicity and expressiveness are preferred to performant code.

Project Contents
****************
|deep_learning|_
    *See* |deep learning readme|_

    The current project content features deep learning work on a basic feed-foward network and, while it has some unfinished work, the implementations are fairly clean and I hope it is easy to use and easy to understand.

|Genetic algorithm|_
    GA implementation for classification datasets.
